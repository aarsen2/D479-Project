        <h2>Car Rentals</h2>
        <p>
          For visitors who prefer flexibility and freedom, renting a car is one of the best ways 
          to experience Taniti at your own pace. Rental agencies near the airport and city center 
          offer a range of vehicles, from compact cars for city driving to rugged jeeps for off-road 
          adventures. Roads are well-maintained, signage is clear, and driving gives you the freedom 
          to discover hidden beaches, mountain trails, and charming local villages far from the crowds.
